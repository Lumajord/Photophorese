# Photophorese  
Simulation to compute the photophoretic force felt by a spherical particle with a temperature gradient inside a rarefied gas. The code is based on the cuda sample Simulations/particles and implements the direct simulation monte-carlo (DSMC) method by [G.A. Bird](http://www.gab.com.au/).
The simulation can also be visualized with [VTK](https://vtk.org/).
